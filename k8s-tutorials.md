# Kubernetes Tutorials

## Install Minikube

https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

## Install `kubectl`

1. Download the `kubectl` binary from [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/#install-kubectl-binary-with-curl-on-windows) official site.

2. Put the `kubectl.exe` binary in a directory accessible in your PATH environment variable.

## Start K8S dashboard

Kubernetes Dashboard allows you to get easily acclimated to your new cluster.

1. Execute
```shell
minikube dashboard
```

2. To access the dashboard endpoint, open the following link with a web browser:
   http://127.0.0.1:36373/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/


## Deploy the YouTube chat app as [**Pod**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)

Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
A Pod is a group of one or more **containers**, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

1. In the k8s configuration file under `k8s/youtube-chat-app-pod.yaml` change `<docker-image-name>:<tag>` to a docker image name existed in your machine.
2. Load this image to Minikube by `minikube image load <docker-image-name>:<tag>` (this step is relevant for [Minikube users only](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/#2-push-images-using-cache-command), in real cluster the image is being pulled from a private container registry).
3. Apply the configurations by: `kubectl apply -f k8s/youtube-chat-app-pod.yaml`

### Understanding Kubernetes Objects [:link:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/)

Almost every Kubernetes object includes a nested object that govern the object's configuration: the object `spec`. 
The `spec` provides a description of the characteristics you want the resource to have: its **desired state**.

In the .yaml file for the Kubernetes object you want to create, you'll need to set values for the following fields:

- `apiVersion` - Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object.
- `kind` - What kind of object you want to create.
- `metadata` - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace.
- `spec` - What state you desire for the object.

**Labels** are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as Deployment.
Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users. E.g.:

- `"release" : "stable"`
- `"environment" : "dev"`
- `"tier" : "backend"`

Via a **Label Selector**, the client/user can identify a set of objects. 

## Deploy the YouTube chat app as [**Deployment**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

A Deployment provides declarative updates for **Pods** and **ReplicaSets**.
A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.

1. In the k8s configuration file under `k8s/youtube-chat-app-deployment.yaml` change `<docker-image-name>:<tag>` to a docker image name existed in your machine (build one if you need to).
2. Load this image to Minikube by `minikube image load <docker-image-name>:<tag>`.
3. Apply the configurations by: `kubectl apply -f k8s/youtube-chat-app-deployment.yaml`
4. Scale the app by changing `replicas: 1` to `replicas: 5`, apply your changes again. Make sure the ScaleSet increases your instances.
5. Perform a rolling update by deploying a new image version (e.g. from `0.0.1` to `0.0.2`) version.

## Pod lifecycle 

### Pod resources

> In order to complete the following demo, you need to install 
> a Metric server in the cluster.
> Metrics Server collects resource metrics (such as CPU and Memory usage) from Kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver.
> Install is by 
> ```shell
> kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
> ```

In this exercise, you create a Pod that has one Container. The Container has a memory request of 50 MiB and a memory limit of 100 MiB. Here's the configuration file for the Pod:

1. Apply by `kubectl apply -f k8s/memory-stress-test.yaml`.
2. Use kubectl top to fetch the metrics for the pod:
```shell
kubectl top pod memory-demo
```

In the next exercise, you create a Pod that has one container. The container has a request of 0.5 CPU and a limit of 1 CPU. Here is the configuration file for the Pod:

1. Apply by `kubectl apply -f k8s/cpu-stress-test.yaml`.
2. Use kubectl top to fetch the metrics for the pod:
```shell
kubectl top pod cpu-demo
```

### Define liveness HTTP probes [:link:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)

1. Add the following liveness probe under to the `youtube-chat-app-deployment.yaml`, such that the `youtube-app` container spec will look like:
```yaml
containers:
   - name: youtube-app
     image: <docker-image-name>:<tag>
     livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 3
      periodSeconds: 3
      failureThreshold: 3
```
2. Apply the changes.
3. (Optional) change the `/health` endpoint in `app/app.py` such that it will fail in 20-30 seconds after the app is up and running, watch k8s replacing unhealthy pods.
4. Add the following readiness probe under to the `youtube-chat-app-deployment.yaml`, such that the `youtube-app` container spec will look like:
```yaml
containers:
   - name: youtube-app
     image: <docker-image-name>:<tag>
     livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
           path: /health
           port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 3
        periodSeconds: 3
        failureThreshold: 3
     readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
           path: /ready
           port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 5
```
5. Watch the behaviour of your app during rolling update.

## Pod horizontal autoscaler

A HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) automatically updates a workload resource, with the aim of automatically scaling the workload to match demand.

1. To simulate a load on the app, we will use the `/load` endpoint defined in the `app.py` file (review it and make sure you understand what it does). 
2. Build the image and deploy it in the cluster (update the `youtube-chat-app-deployment.yaml` according to the new image tag to apply the changes). 
3. Now that the server is running with the new endpoint, create the autoscaler:
```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/youtube-chat-app-autoscale.yaml
```
4. Next, see how the autoscaler reacts to increased load. To do this, you'll start a different Pod to act as a client. The container within the client Pod runs in an infinite loop, sending queries to the php-apache service.
```shell
# Run this in a separate terminal
# so that the load generation continues and you can carry on with the rest of the steps
kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --rm --image=busybox:1.28 --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -c "while sleep 0.1; do wget -q -O- http://youtube-app-service:8080/load; done"
```
5. (Optional) Perform rolling update **during scale**.

[Read more](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/) to see how k8s can scale based on _packets per second_, _requests per second_ or even metrics not related to Kubernetes objects (such as messages in queue).

## Secret and ConfigMap

Recall the multi-app architecture we created using Docker compose:

![](img/multi-app.png)

We would like to deploy it in the k8s cluster. 

**Before we begin, clean your cluster from resources.** 

### The YouTube chat app

1. For simplicity, you are given the app version that designed to talk with an external MySQL db. The code can be found in `app-multi`, so no need to switch branches. 
2. Build the image according to the Dockerfile in `app-multi`. 
3. Deploy it using the `youtube-chat-app-multi.yaml` configuration file (does it work? why?).
4. We would like to create a cluster [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) object to store the root user password for the MySQL database. Review the secret object in `k8s/mysql-secret.yaml` and apply it:
```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/mysql-secret.yaml
```
5. Deploy the MySQL deployment by applying `mysql-deployment.yaml` configuration file.
6. Test your app.

7. Now let's say we want to allow maximum of 50 connection to our DB. We would like to find a useful way to "inject" this config to our pre-built `mysql:5.7` image. For that, the [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) object can assist.
   In the `mysql` Docker image, custom configurations for MySQL can be placed in `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d` directory, any file ends with `.cnf` under this directory, will be applied as an additional configurations to MySQL. But how can we "insert" a custom file to the image? keep reading...
8. Review the ConfigMap object under `mysql-config.yaml`. And apply it.
9. Comment **in** the two snippets in `mysql-deployment.yaml` and apply the changes.
